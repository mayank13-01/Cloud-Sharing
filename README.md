# Cloud Sharing

The File Sharing API, developed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, offers a seamless solution for sharing files among users. This RESTful API simplifies the process of uploading, storing, and accessing files securely.

# Installation

After obtaining the project by either cloning the repository or downloading it, navigate to the root directory of the project using a command line interface. Execute either `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all essential dependencies required for the application to function smoothly. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure proper configuration by locating the `.env.example` file within the project's directory and renaming it to `.env`. Open the `.env` file and input all necessary credentials, API keys, or sensitive information as per the provided examples or instructions, allowing the application to access required resources securely. Completing these steps ensures a successful setup of the project with the essential dependencies and configurations.
